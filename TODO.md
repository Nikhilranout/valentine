# TODO: Improve Responsive Watermark 'Made By Nikhil'

- [x] Add watermark div to home.html outside the container
- [ ] Update .watermark styles in style.css for better effectiveness (higher opacity, better visibility, diagonal positioning)
- [ ] Enhance responsive adjustments (reduce size on mobile, adjust on tablets/large screens)
- [ ] Test the page again by opening home.html to verify improved watermark and responsiveness
